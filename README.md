## Introduction

This repository documents my journey learning DevOps practices and tools. It serves as both a personal reference and a resource for others starting their DevOps journey. The goal is to compile practical knowledge that bridges the gap between theory and real-world implementation.

## Core DevOps Concepts

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.
  - *Key Insight*: Small, frequent code changes reduce integration problems and improve software quality.

- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)**: Automating the delivery of applications to selected infrastructure environments.
  - *Key Insight*: Automated deployment pipelines ensure consistent and reliable releases.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code instead of manual processes.
  - *Key Insight*: Treating infrastructure like application code enables version control, testing, and automation.

- **Microservices Architecture**: Building applications as a collection of loosely coupled services.
  - *Key Insight*: Enables independent deployment and scaling of application components.

- **DevSecOps**: Integrating security practices within the DevOps process.
  - *Key Insight*: Security should be built in from the beginning, not added as an afterthought.

## Essential Tools

### Version Control
- **Git**
  - Basic commands: `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, `git branch`
    https://youtu.be/hrTQipWp6co?si=ot_b4nLxd2xLdKs4
    git add .
    git reset .
    git checkout -- --> This one is to discard the changes made from the reset.
    git log
    git checkout "commitHash from git log command which version you want to take" --> To view the previous version of your code ...

    Restoring code to previous version:
        

    Current commmit and behind the current commit
