# Git: Zero to Professional Reference Guide

A comprehensive handbook for mastering Git version control - drawn from my personal experience using Git with VS Code across numerous projects.

## Introduction to Git

I've been using Git for years, and trust me, once you get the hang of it, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in your code, letting you and your team work together without stepping on each other's toes.

**Key Concepts I Use Daily:**

- **Commit**: Think of this as a savepoint in a game - you can always go back to it
- **Branch**: Where I experiment with new features without breaking my working code
- **Repository**: The entire project folder with all its history
- **Remote**: Where I push my code so my teammates can access it (usually GitHub)

## Basic Command Line Navigation

Even though I mostly use VS Code's Git integration now, I still find myself using these terminal commands regularly:

| Command | What I Use It For | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ls` | Quick check of what's in my current folder | `ls` |
| `cd` | Jumping between project directories | `cd ~/projects/client-website` |
| `mkdir` | Creating new project folders | `mkdir new-microservice` |
| `pwd` | Double-checking where I am when I get lost | `pwd` |

> Pro tip: I've set up tab completion for Git commands in my terminal - saves me tons of typing mistakes!
